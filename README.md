# HelloWorld
My first phyton file and repository

In **myTest.py** I started with procedural programming in python: Here I have tested general behavior of python regarding objects and their types, experimented with functions and calculations.

In **GUI_PyQT5.py** I tried to write object oriented python code. I have created a GUI with PyQt5 see https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt for more information.
